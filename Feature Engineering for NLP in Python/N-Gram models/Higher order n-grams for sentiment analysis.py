# Similar to a previous exercise, we are going to build a classifier that can detect if the review of a particular movie is positive or negative. However, this time, we will use n-grams up to n=2 for the task.

# The n-gram training reviews are available as X_train_ng. The corresponding test reviews are available as X_test_ng. Finally, use y_train and y_test to access the training and test sentiment classes respectively.

# Define an instance of MultinomialNB 
clf_ng = MultinomialNB()

# Fit the classifier 
clf_ng.fit(X_train_ng, y_train)

# Measure the accuracy 
accuracy = clf_ng.score(X_test_ng,y_test)
print("The accuracy of the classifier on the test set is %.3f" % accuracy)

# Predict the sentiment of a negative review
review = "The movie was not good. The plot had several holes and the acting lacked panache."
prediction = clf_ng.predict(ng_vectorizer.transform([review]))[0]
print("The sentiment predicted by the classifier is %i" % (prediction))


# The accuracy of the classifier on the test set is 0.758
# The sentiment predicted by the classifier is 0
