# In this exercise, you have been provided with a lem_corpus which contains the pre-processed versions of the movie taglines from the previous exercise. In other words, the taglines have been lowercased and lemmatized, and stopwords have been removed.

# Your job is to generate the bag of words representation bow_lem_matrix for these lemmatized taglines and compare its shape with that of bow_matrix obtained in the previous exercise. The first five lemmatized taglines in lem_corpus have been printed to the console for you to examine.

# Import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

# Create CountVectorizer object
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()

# Generate matrix of word vectors
bow_lem_matrix = vectorizer.fit_transform(lem_corpus)

# Print the shape of bow_lem_matrix
print(bow_lem_matrix.shape)
