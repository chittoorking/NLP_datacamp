# Here's a small sample of a dataset created to train a new entity type WEBSITE. The original dataset contains a few thousand sentences. In this exercise, you'll be doing the labeling by hand. In real life, you probably want to automate this and use an annotation tool â€“ for example, Brat, a popular open-source solution, or Prodigy, our own annotation tool that integrates with spaCy.

# After this exercise you will be nearly done with the course! If you enjoyed it, feel free to send Ines a thank you via Twitter - she'll appreciate it! Tweet to Ines
