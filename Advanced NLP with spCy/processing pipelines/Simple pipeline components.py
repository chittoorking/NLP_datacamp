# Simple components
# The example shows a custom component that prints the character length of a document. Can you complete it? spacy has already been imported for you.

# Define the custom component
def length_component(doc):
    # Get the doc's length
    doc_length = len(doc)
    print("This document is {} tokens long.".format(doc_length))
    # Return the doc
    return doc
  
# Add the length_component to the existing pipeline as the first component.

# Load the small English model
nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')
  
# Add the component first in the pipeline and print the pipe names
nlp.add_pipe(length_component,first=True)
print(nlp.pipe_names)

# Try out the new pipeline and process any text with the nlp object â€“ for example "This is a sentence.".
# Process a text
doc = nlp("This is a sentence")
